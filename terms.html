  <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: January 1, 2025</p>
  <p>
    These Terms & Conditions (“Terms”) govern your use of Wholesale eBay Products, the wholesale catalog,
    downloadable product packages, and all fulfillment services provided by the owner/operator
    (“we,” “us,” “our”). By accessing or using this website or purchasing any products, you agree to these Terms.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>1. Program Description</h2>
  <p>
    Wholesale eBay Products provides physical goods, digital goods, images, titles, descriptions,
    and other selling materials intended for resale on eBay or other online marketplaces.
    We operate as a U.S.-based product supplier and fulfillment handler, shipping all orders from our warehouse.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>2. No Guarantee of Sales or Earnings</h2>
  <p>
    We supply products and materials, but we do not guarantee:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>That you will make a profit</li>
    <li>That your listings will sell</li>
    <li>That eBay will approve or keep any listing live</li>
    <li>That eBay will not remove or restrict your seller account</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    All financial results depend on your pricing, listing practices, customer service, shipping preferences,
    and compliance with eBay policies.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>3. Product Fulfillment & Shipping</h2>
  <p>
    All products are shipped by us directly from our U.S. warehouse. Once a seller marks an order as “sold”
    in their personalized Google Sheet and remits the appropriate wholesale payment:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Orders are typically shipped within 1–3 business days</li>
    <li>Tracking numbers are provided after shipment</li>
    <li>We are not responsible for delays caused by USPS, UPS, FedEx, or customs</li>
    <li>We are not responsible for incorrect addresses provided by the seller</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Once an item is shipped, our responsibility is limited to providing a tracking number.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>4. Returns & Replacements</h2>

  <h3>4.1 Physical Products</h3>
  <p>
    Physical products may be returned for a refund <strong>only if they are unopened, unused,
    and returned in their original condition and packaging</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>Refund eligibility follows eBay's standard return window (typically 30 days).</p>
  <p>
    Once we receive and inspect the returned product, we will issue a refund of the wholesale price paid.
    Shipping fees are non-refundable unless the item was defective upon arrival.
  </p>

  <h3>4.2 Digital Products & Software Keys</h3>
  <p>
    Digital products, software licenses, or digital access keys are <strong>not eligible for refunds</strong>.
    However, if a digital key is defective or fails to activate:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>We will replace it with a new working key at no cost to you.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A replacement key is the sole remedy for all digital products.
  </p>

  <h3>4.3 Seller-Caused Returns</h3>
  <p>
    If a customer return occurs due to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Incorrect listing created by the seller</li>
    <li>Misrepresentation of condition</li>
    <li>Wrong item shipped because of incorrect seller data</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The seller is fully responsible for all costs related to the return and replacement.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>5. Marketplace Policy Compliance</h2>
  <p>
    You are responsible for ensuring your listings comply with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>eBay policies</li>
    <li>Brand guidelines</li>
    <li>Image usage rules</li>
    <li>Local/state/federal laws</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We are not responsible for eBay listing removals, account restrictions, or policy violations.
